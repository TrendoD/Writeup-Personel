# CTF Writeup: The Numbers

## Introduction
"The Numbers" is a cryptography challenge that involves decoding a sequence of numbers to reveal a hidden message, referencing a famous quote from popular culture.

## Challenge Description
In this challenge, we are presented with a sequence of numbers:

```
16 9 3 15 3 20 6 { 20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14 }
```

The challenge title "The Numbers" and the question "what do they mean?" hint that these numbers represent something significant. The format of the numbers, with curly braces `{ }` in the middle, suggests they might represent a flag format typical in CTF competitions. Our task is to decipher what these numbers mean to reveal the hidden flag.

## Solution Process

### Step 1: Analyze the pattern of numbers

First, let's observe what we're working with:
- The numbers range from 1 to 21
- There are curly braces `{ }` that seem to separate parts of the sequence
- The structure resembles a typical CTF flag format

Since we're dealing with numbers that don't exceed 26 (the number of letters in the English alphabet), a reasonable hypothesis is that these numbers represent letter positions in the alphabet.

### Step 2: Apply the substitution cipher

The most common letter-to-number mapping in cryptography is:
```
A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Z = 26
```

Let's decode each number by converting it to its corresponding letter in the alphabet:

```
16 → P (16th letter)
9 → I (9th letter)
3 → C (3rd letter)
15 → O (15th letter)
3 → C (3rd letter)
20 → T (20th letter)
6 → F (6th letter)
{ → { (keep as is)
20 → T (20th letter)
8 → H (8th letter)
5 → E (5th letter)
14 → N (14th letter)
21 → U (21st letter)
13 → M (13th letter)
2 → B (2nd letter)
5 → E (5th letter)
18 → R (18th letter)
19 → S (19th letter)
13 → M (13th letter)
1 → A (1st letter)
19 → S (19th letter)
15 → O (15th letter)
14 → N (14th letter)
} → } (keep as is)
```

### Step 3: Assemble the decoded message

Putting all these letters together, we get:

```
PICOCTF{THENUMBERSMASON}
```

This reveals our flag and also explains the reference in the challenge title. "The numbers, Mason! What do they mean?" is a famous quote from the video game Call of Duty: Black Ops.
